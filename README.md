# Study Session Planner

## Overview
The Study Session Planner is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that organizes a study session by storing its topic and duration, calculating total time with functions, assigning priority using conditionals, and displaying a formatted plan. Created as part of my Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course, it showcases fundamental JavaScript skills for my journey to become a full-stack developer.

## Features
- Stores study details (topic, duration) in an object using variables.
- Assigns priority (Low, Medium, High) based on duration using a function with conditionals.
- Validates duration with `typeof` and logical operators in a function expression.
- Calculates total time (including breaks) using an arrow function with a default parameter.
- Rounds results with the `Math` object.
- Displays the plan with template literals, string concatenation, and string methods like `toUpperCase()`.
- Handles `undefined` data for missing study sessions.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core language for logic and output.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to run the program.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
